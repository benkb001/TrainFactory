//TODO: lp write, not using currently, if i will it needs to be changed a lot,
//could possibly change all the depths of everything that migth have a depth to 1f and then draw
// a bg at 0.99f? and then when bg is destroyed set all their depths back to what they were before? 

//but for now just moving the camera is fine.
