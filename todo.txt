**** URGENT **** 

*** BUGS **** 

* Fix LinearLayout stall infinitely if too small bug 
* Fix bug clicking unresponsive ? 
* progress bar like 1% when it stops crafting
* I think there is a bug with position on chest being relative to (0, 0)
* Machine should remove required items immediately when beginning crafting 
* weird camera flash happening when clicking through inventory
    * probably need to delayed pop
* need to redraw ui when returning to train interface after adding a cart
* progress bar is starting out with a percentage of green? 
* Should redraw the city view if a train arrives
* game is destroying the factory scene even if you aren't in the train, and 
  not redrawing if you are in the train
* If an item in a player's hand is returned to inv but inv is full,
  item should stay in player's hand.
* Machines still crafting if game is paused, need to have machines 
  connected to World.wt instead of using ticks directly
* intermittent bug with split item removing half the items
* probably related, sometimes fast transfer doesn't work even if there are empty slots 
  * probably a slot is being thought of as having an item due to itemID != "" 
* World time passage should resume automatically when exiting map view 

**** NEED TO TEST **** 

* test player label change automatically when train arrives 
* test map redrawing when it is supposed to
* WorldTime ! ! ! ! 
* Bootstrap.InitWorld
* ButtonSystem.RegisterHold
* Stepper holding
* Inventory split 
* Speed buttons, pause button
* Machine crafting multiple at once logic
* new inventory transfer functions 
* TAL
* Train flag update, isEmbarking
* ID.GetComponent
* Set Train Program Button/System
* New machine flow

**** CLEAN UP **** 

* Move draw button logic into generic 
* Move click system logic into generic 
* Move stuff in drawMachineRequest to appropriate new files 

**** NEXT FEATURES **** 

* Add a stepper to set priority in machine interface 
* Add a stepper to set numbe of recipes to store before letting lower prio machines take. 

* Fix TAL to not let trains go places if there is not a connection at the city they are currently at

**** CLEANUP AFTER FIRST PROTOTYPE IS DONE **** 

* Change how scene works
  * I am thinking each potential UI screen or level, etc, has a hardcoded scene value and 
    camera position, then we just need to keep track of which scene to go to. This will 
    decouple how a player got to a scene and how many times we should pop. 
* Catch up on tests
* Use a UI library, Gum looks pretty good. Whatever i pick will need scrolling, paging, 
  rows/columns, steppers, text input, grayboxing, and a way to easily integrate with the code i have. 
  Ideally it will be organized into classes or i can easily make a wrapper to have components. 
  Once I've experimented with the new library and figured out how to fit it in, 
  i need to refactor LinearLayout and Button with new UI components and integrate them. 
* Go through all files and try to decouple, find a guide online to support this 

**** FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Make some statistics available on the map ui
  (like how many idle trains there are, how much resources of each type you have, etc)
* Make a way to manually get fuel in case you run out of wood/water
* Add player inventory to city interface, so player can put stuff from their inv to city
* Make inventory move if player walks over it
* Add progress bar to overworld machines
* Add combat and reward system
    * Rogue-like/perma-progression mix, time-limited events
      for special rewards at outside cities, permanently available 
      one at the factory. 
* Add warning if player is going to send a train with an empty inv
* Make it so LinearLayout is pageable 
    * This will be important once player gets a high number of trains, 
      but also if we add a high number of machines to Factory
* Make it so trains cant run over other trains 
* Make it so trains need fuel
* Add a text input view
* Combine text input with steppers to say how much of things you want to move 
    between inventories, and how much you want to request to craft
* Add an option to steppers to make them not negative
* Add basic save/load 
* Add some default toasts
* Make stepper fast when you hold down
* Make it so button to enter train doesn't appear if player opened map not at a train station 
* Make scrollable windows 
* Add some tutorial toasts 
* Make a system to ensure collidables cannot overlap as this results in buggy behavior
* Add number of requested items to machine UI 

**** FAR FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add a tile system for rpg mode
* Implement dialogue
* Augment Sprite/DrawSystem to handle animation/spritesheets
* Implement player making custom notifications based on train conditions, 
    like a toast pops up when the train has a certain amount of wood or something 
* Consider making a train interior so player can do certain things while waiting inside a train? 

**** NICE TO HAVE LOW PRIORITY **** 

* Add a way to print the world state for debugging
* Add SpaceEven to LinearLayout
* Add a way for sprites to be drawn separately from collision box 
* Add a label to progress bar in machine interface to make it clear what it is when not moving

**** NOT SURE WE WANT BUT MAYBE **** 

* Make drawing System based
* Make UI Drawing based on screen coordinates
* Make inventory draw messages automatically move around or resize other inventories as necessary
