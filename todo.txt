**** URGENT **** 

*** BUGS **** 

* randomly zooming in ? 
* Camera lag when teleporting, exiting interfaces, basically entity tracking is
  a bit wonky
* Not decreasing received damage after picking up +1 armor
  
**** TEST **** 

* Partitioning, especially GetIntersectingEntities
* ConnectCities
* Train.Move()
* Train fuel consumption
* Upgrade train fuel consumption/power

**** CLEAN UP **** 

* Make code for constants => json, and load 
  this instead of using bootstrap.initWorld
* Add train position to save/load
* Make carts items
* Clean enemySpawn and movementSystem files to split classes into individual files
* GetByID should throw exceptions when not found, such as city.GetByID
* Add machine speed level to persistent state

**** NEXT FEATURES **** 

* Make drawing cities use Layout class/ tiles
* Add UI for exponential upgrades to machines

**** FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Make it so player has to refresh the city interface to see which trains 
  have arrived, but when trains leave the button gets grayed out to 
  show the train isn't there anymore, and if refreshed the button will disappear
* Add a button to close menu
* Add a way to skip to harder rounds in hpp
* Add a system to highlight entities if player is in interacting range
* Add warning if player is going to send a train with an empty inv
* Add some default toasts
* Catch up on PersistentState 
  * Player written programs 
* Add tutorials 
  * Syntax for TAL will def be needed 
* Add a way to pause/resume trains running on a program
  * Will need an interface that displays all trains, but 
    doesn't allow you to go into train interface
* Add an equipment type to upgrade mobility, ie longer duration/shorter cd, 
  or more decrease from parrying 
* Add new gun types 
* Add new level layouts 
* Add new cities 
* Make it so only cities that have a railroad that can connect them to an 
  accessible city are drawn on the map

**** FAR FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Implement dialogue
* Augment Sprite/DrawSystem to handle animation/spritesheets
* Consider making a train interior so player can do certain things while waiting inside a train
* Add some tutorials/guides
* Add random deals, time-limited, city-specific, require a large amount of items based on where player is at, 
  if completed give high rewards 
* Add random fights at each city that also give high-rewards if defeated
* Use OpenFileDialog class to let players submit a program file from their cpu

**** NICE TO HAVE LOW PRIORITY **** 

* Add a way to print the world state for debugging
* Add SpaceEven to LinearLayout
* Add a way for sprites to be drawn separately from collision box 
* Add a label to progress bar in machine interface to make it clear what it is when not moving
* TAL Upgrades: 
  * Add if statements 
  * Add toasts ? 
  * Add statements to set machine priority, storage size
  * Add expression to get time since arrival/time since departure
  * Add comments
  * Add parentheses
* Make a system to ensure collidables cannot overlap as this results in buggy behavior

**** NOT SURE WE WANT BUT MAYBE **** 

* Make drawing System based
* Make UI Drawing based on screen coordinates
* Make inventory draw messages automatically move around or resize other inventories as necessary
* Chest system, currently bugged but could revamp it 
  * possibly relative to zero-zero being an error, not pausing scene definitely
