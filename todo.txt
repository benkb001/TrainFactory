**** URGENT **** 

*** BUGS **** 

* randomly zooming in ? 
* Not drawing traveling interface when exiting map if player is in train
* Camera lag when teleporting, exiting interfaces, basically entity tracking is
  a bit wonky

**** NEED TO TEST **** 

* TextInput
* Persistent Data
* UI for setting program, if any clear assertions
* ScreenAnchor system 
* LL scroll paging
* LLwrap depth setting when adding a child with children
* Player walk over inv system
* Frame.IntersectsWith
* Combat systems 
  * Shoot, death, bullet decay, damage, armor, equipment, parry
* Purchase button
* PlayerWrap.GetPlayer
* EntityFactory.AddData<T>

**** CLEAN UP **** 

* Remove DrawTrainsViewSystem and DrawMachinesViewSystems
* Theres a bunch of VirtualMouse.SetCoordinates(10, 10) lines
  that cause tests to fail if we slightly change how drawing 
  linear Layout or inventory works, at least we can unify them 
  into one constant value or change how we are testing this 

**** NEXT FEATURES **** 

* Don't draw player inv in city interface if player not at city
* Make it so assemblers can assemble multiple at once
* Ensure temp buffs are removed either when entering or exiting a city, 
  right now only happens when player dies

**** FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add a way to 'unlock' new cities by spending rails/other resources
* Add a way to skip to harder rounds in hpp
* Add a system to highlight entities if player is in interacting range
* Add warning if player is going to send a train with an empty inv
* Add some default toasts
* Make it so trains need fuel
* Catch up on PersistentState 
  * Player written programs 
* Add tutorials 
  * Syntax for TAL will def be needed 
* Add a way to pause/resume trains running on a program
  * Will need an interface that displays all trains, but 
    doesn't allow you to go into train interface
* Add an equipment type to upgrade mobility, ie longer distance/shorter cd

**** FAR FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add a tile system for rpg mode
* Implement dialogue
* Augment Sprite/DrawSystem to handle animation/spritesheets
* Consider making a train interior so player can do certain things while waiting inside a train
* Add some tutorials/guides
* Add random deals, time-limited, city-specific, require a large amount of items based on where player is at, 
  if completed give high rewards 
* Add random fights at each city that also give high-rewards if defeated
* Use OpenFileDialog class to let players submit a program file from their cpu

**** NICE TO HAVE LOW PRIORITY **** 

* Add a way to print the world state for debugging
* Add SpaceEven to LinearLayout
* Add a way for sprites to be drawn separately from collision box 
* Add a label to progress bar in machine interface to make it clear what it is when not moving
* TAL Upgrades: 
  * Add if statements 
  * Add toasts ? 
  * Add statements to set machine priority, storage size
  * Add expression to get time since arrival/time since departure
  * Add comments
* Make a system to ensure collidables cannot overlap as this results in buggy behavior

**** NOT SURE WE WANT BUT MAYBE **** 

* Make drawing System based
* Make UI Drawing based on screen coordinates
* Make inventory draw messages automatically move around or resize other inventories as necessary
* Make it so trains cant run over other trains 
* Chest system, currently bugged but could revamp it 
  * possibly relative to zero-zero being an error, not pausing scene definitely
