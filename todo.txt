**** URGENT **** 

*** BUGS **** 

* Fix bug clicking unresponsive ? 
* Chest system, possibly relative to zero-zero being an error, not pausing scene definitely
* Should redraw the city view if a train arrives
* intermittent bug with split item removing half the items
* probably related, sometimes fast transfer doesn't work even if there are empty slots 
  * probably a slot is being thought of as having an item due to itemID != "" 
* World time passage should resume automatically when exiting map view 

**** NEED TO TEST **** 

* Inventory split 
* Speed buttons, pause button
* Machine crafting multiple at once logic
* new inventory transfer functions 
* TAL
* Train flag update, isEmbarking
* ID.GetComponent
* Set Train Program Button/System
* New machine flow
* New scene system 

**** CLEAN UP **** 

* Add train program to train ui 

**** NEXT FEATURES **** 

* Catch up on tests
* Switch UI components to use Gum 
  * First, figure out how to import the package with nuget 
  * Then, get a simple working example
  * Figure out how to control UI being drawn relative to screen coordinates, or world coordinates
  * Figure out how to integrate with button, stepper, and linear layout systems
  * Figure out how to get scrolling menus and use them where necessary
  * Decouple linear layout use with inventory container drawing logic, 
    possibly also stepper logic
* Add basic save/load 
* Add a way for players to input their own program for trains
* Make some statistics available on the map ui
  (like how many idle trains there are, how much resources of each type you have, etc)
* Add player inventory to city interface, so player can put stuff from their inv to city
* Make inventory move if player walks over it
* Add progress bar to overworld machines
* Add number of stored items to machine ui 
* Make it so set train program button also removes old train program if it exists
* Fix TAL to not let trains go places if there is not a connection at the city they are currently at
* Machines still crafting if game is paused, need to have machines 
  connected to World.wt instead of using ticks directly

**** FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Make a system to ensure collidables cannot overlap as this results in buggy behavior
* Add some default toasts
* Add some tutorials/guides
* Make it so trains cant run over other trains 
* Make it so trains need fuel
* Add combat and reward system
    * Rogue-like/perma-progression mix, time-limited events
      for special rewards at outside cities, permanently available 
      one at the factory.
        * Possibly 'time-crystals' which give you resources using a 
          heuristic algorithm to calculate how much of each thing the player 
          would get if that much time passed (like in perfect tower)
* Add warning if player is going to send a train with an empty inv

**** FAR FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add a tile system for rpg mode
* Implement dialogue
* Augment Sprite/DrawSystem to handle animation/spritesheets
* Implement player making custom notifications based on train conditions, 
    like a toast pops up when the train has a certain amount of wood or something 
* Consider making a train interior so player can do certain things while waiting inside a train? 

**** NICE TO HAVE LOW PRIORITY **** 

* Add a way to print the world state for debugging
* Add SpaceEven to LinearLayout
* Add a way for sprites to be drawn separately from collision box 
* Add a label to progress bar in machine interface to make it clear what it is when not moving
* TAL Upgrades: 
  * Add if statements 
  * Add toasts 
  * Add statements to set machine priority, storage size

**** NOT SURE WE WANT BUT MAYBE **** 

* Make drawing System based
* Make UI Drawing based on screen coordinates
* Make inventory draw messages automatically move around or resize other inventories as necessary
