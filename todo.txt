*** BUGS **** 

* Fix LinearLayout stall infinitely if too small bug 
* Fix bug clicking unresponsive 

**** NEED TO TEST **** 

* test player label change automatically when train arrives 

**** NEXT FEATURES **** 

* Add player inventory/holding items 
    * For now player inventory can be 1 row 10 columns, 
      player component can track index of held item, add 
      a system to increment/decrement when player scrolls, 
      and there will be a label that changes or is destroyed 
      based on which item is held. then when player interacts with 
      things, held item can be derived through the entity associated 
      with the interactor
* Add machines for creating new trains, and the other recipes
* Create basic layouts for the cities
* Add liquid trains
    * Will need to add something to inventory to put a limit on 
      the number of items a cell can hold based on itemid, and 
      also which item ids an inventory can or cant hold 
* Create an interface for upgrading machines/viewing machine level 
* Create an interface for upgrading trains 

**** FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Make it so LinearLayout is pageable 
    * This will be important once player gets a high number of trains, 
      but also if we add a high number of machines to Factory
* Make it so trains cant run over other trains 
* Make it so trains need fuel
* Add a text input view
* Combine text input with steppers to say how much of things you want to move 
    between inventories, and how much you want to request to craft
* Add an option to steppers to make them not negative
* Add basic save/load 
* Add some default toasts
* Implement better click for buttons 
* Make stepper fast when you hold down
* Make it so button to enter train doesn't appear if player opened map not at a train station 

**** FAR FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add a tile system for rpg mode
* Implement dialogue
* Augment Sprite/DrawSystem to handle animation/spritesheets
* Write a coding language so players can code their trains 
* Implement adding commands to trains (like once it gets to the next city, do a thing) 
* Implement adding conditionals and loops to train behavior 
* Implement player making custom notifications based on train conditions, 
    like a toast pops up when the train has a certain amount of wood or something 

**** NICE TO HAVE LOW PRIORITY **** 

* Add SpaceEven to LinearLayout
* Add a way for sprites to be drawn separately from collision box 

**** NOT SURE WE WANT BUT MAYBE **** 

* Make drawing System based
* Make UI Drawing based on screen coordinates
* Make inventory draw messages automatically move around or resize other inventories as necessary
