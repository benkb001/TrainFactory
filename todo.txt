**** URGENT **** 

*** BUGS **** 

* Chest system, possibly relative to zero-zero being an error, not pausing scene definitely
* randomly zooming in ? 
* Clicking m to go to map shouldn't happen if player is typing

**** NEED TO TEST **** 

* TextInput
* Persistent Data
* UI for setting program, if any clear assertions
* ScreenAnchor system 
* LL scroll paging
* LLwrap depth setting when adding a child with children
* Player walk over inv system

**** CLEAN UP **** 

* Remove DrawTrainsViewSystem and DrawMachinesViewSystems
* Theres a bunch of VirtualMouse.SetCoordinates(10, 10) lines
  that cause tests to fail if we slightly change how drawing 
  linear Layout or inventory works, at least we can unify them 
  into one constant value or change how we are testing this 

**** NEXT FEATURES **** 

* Improve textbox drawing for textInput
  * begin drawing cursor 
  * autopage with cursor

**** FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add combat and reward system
    * Rogue-like/perma-progression mix, time-limited events
      for special rewards at outside cities, permanently available 
      one at the factory.
        * Possibly 'time-crystals' which give you resources using a 
          heuristic algorithm to calculate how much of each thing the player 
          would get if that much time passed (like in perfect tower)
* Add warning if player is going to send a train with an empty inv
* Add some default toasts
* Make it so trains need fuel
* Change how carts work 
  * Probably trains should have a different inventory for each 
    type, such as solid/liquid, and others if added. Then adding a 
    cart just increases a scaling factor on the stack sizes of the 
    corresponding inventory type 
* Catch up on PersistentState 
  * Player written programs 
  * machine.lifetimeProductsCrafted
* Add tutorials 
  * Syntax for TAL will def be needed 

**** FAR FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add a tile system for rpg mode
* Implement dialogue
* Augment Sprite/DrawSystem to handle animation/spritesheets
* Consider making a train interior so player can do certain things while waiting inside a train
* Add some tutorials/guides
* Add random deals, time-limited, city-specific, require a large amount of items based on where player is at, 
  if completed give high rewards 

**** NICE TO HAVE LOW PRIORITY **** 

* Add a way to print the world state for debugging
* Add SpaceEven to LinearLayout
* Add a way for sprites to be drawn separately from collision box 
* Add a label to progress bar in machine interface to make it clear what it is when not moving
* TAL Upgrades: 
  * Add if statements 
  * Add toasts ? 
  * Add statements to set machine priority, storage size
  * Add expression to get time since arrival/time since departure
  * Add comments
* Make a system to ensure collidables cannot overlap as this results in buggy behavior

**** NOT SURE WE WANT BUT MAYBE **** 

* Make drawing System based
* Make UI Drawing based on screen coordinates
* Make inventory draw messages automatically move around or resize other inventories as necessary
* Make it so trains cant run over other trains
