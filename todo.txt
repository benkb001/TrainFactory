**** URGENT **** 

*** BUGS **** 

* Chest system, possibly relative to zero-zero being an error, not pausing scene definitely
* randomly zooming in ? 

**** NEED TO TEST **** 

* TextInput
* Persistent Data
* UI for setting program, if any clear assertions

**** NEXT FEATURES **** 

* Improve UI
  * Use LL Paging where appropriate
    * Machine list in factory, train list, eventually inventory probably, 
      but for now container is good, having 2 pagers right next to each other 
      probably is a bit awk 
    * Improve textbox drawing for textInput
      * begin drawing cursor 
      * autopage with cursor
* Add a way for players to input their own program for trains
  * Add a system to associate the button that connects a program to a train, 
    for entities that also have a component for player written script input, 
    that runs before the regular submit system. This will query the textInput 
    components for the program and program name and set the buttons fields. 
  * Make it so submit button toasts if compiling was successful or not
  * Move classes into appropriate files once done, from systems/ui/click/SetTrainProgram.cs
  * Add close menu system stuff for new interfaces 
    * Maybe could make new generic stuff have an interface to get a menu object 
      and then could refactor other draw things to use it? 
* Make some statistics available on the map ui
  (like how many idle trains there are, how much resources of each type you have, etc)
* Add player inventory to city interface, so player can put stuff from their inv to city
* Make inventory move if player walks over it
* Add number of stored items to machine ui 
* Machines still crafting if game is paused, need to have machines 
  connected to World.wt instead of using ticks directly
* Add train program to train ui 

**** FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add combat and reward system
    * Rogue-like/perma-progression mix, time-limited events
      for special rewards at outside cities, permanently available 
      one at the factory.
        * Possibly 'time-crystals' which give you resources using a 
          heuristic algorithm to calculate how much of each thing the player 
          would get if that much time passed (like in perfect tower)
* Add warning if player is going to send a train with an empty inv
* Add some default toasts
* Make it so trains need fuel
* Change how carts work 
  * Probably trains should have a different inventory for each 
    type, such as solid/liquid, and others if added. Then adding a 
    cart just increases a scaling factor on the stack sizes of the 
    corresponding inventory type 

**** FAR FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add a tile system for rpg mode
* Implement dialogue
* Augment Sprite/DrawSystem to handle animation/spritesheets
* Consider making a train interior so player can do certain things while waiting inside a train
* Add some tutorials/guides
* Add random deals, time-limited, city-specific, require a large amount of items based on where player is at, 
  if completed give high rewards 

**** NICE TO HAVE LOW PRIORITY **** 

* Add a way to print the world state for debugging
* Add SpaceEven to LinearLayout
* Add a way for sprites to be drawn separately from collision box 
* Add a label to progress bar in machine interface to make it clear what it is when not moving
* TAL Upgrades: 
  * Add if statements 
  * Add toasts ? 
  * Add statements to set machine priority, storage size
  * Add expression to get time since arrival/time since departure
  * Add comments
* Make a system to ensure collidables cannot overlap as this results in buggy behavior

**** NOT SURE WE WANT BUT MAYBE **** 

* Make drawing System based
* Make UI Drawing based on screen coordinates
* Make inventory draw messages automatically move around or resize other inventories as necessary
* Make it so trains cant run over other trains
