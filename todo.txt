* Make drawing System based
* Make UI Drawing based on screen coordinates
* Make inventory draw messages automatically move around or resize other inventories as necessary
* Implement better click for buttons 
* Make stepper fast when you hold down
* Fix LinearLayout stall infinitely if too small bug 
* Add SpaceEven to LinearLayout
* Add a way for sprites to be drawn separately from collision box 

* Fix bug clicking unresponsive 
* Add player entering trains/moving between cities 

    * Firstly, add a button to add/remove player from train, 
      button will only appear if the train is parked at the city 
      the player is at 
    * Secondly, need to deal with the scene the player was previously
      at when they interacted with the 'train station' 
        * Possibly can derive which scene it is and make a function to 
          clear all entities in that scene 
        * This will need to be done only when the train fully embarks 
    * Thirdly, need to deal with what happens when player 'closes' map 
      if they are in a train 
        * Could add a system before closeMenu that checks if there is a 
          MapUI element, here we can check the state of the player, if they are 
          traveling we draw a little message of where they are traveling, 
          current time, and arrival time
    * Finally, need to deal with drawing the target city when player 
      arrives
        * Can add a system to make a message on train arrival which 
        checks if the player is in it and either make a toast or just
        draw the new scene, if toast then in the previous described system 
        we can draw the city we want 

* Add an option to steppers to make them not negative
* Add a text input view
* Combine text input with steppers to say how much of things you want to move 
    between inventories, and how much you want to request to craft

* Add basic save/load 
* Add some default toasts

* Add a tile system for rpg mode
* Make player able to hold a tool 
* Add a scrollable toolbar 
* Make player able to use a tool 
* Implement dialogue
* Augment Sprite/DrawSystem to handle animation/spritesheets

* Write a coding language so players can code their trains ^^
* Implement adding commands to trains (like once it gets to the next city, do a thing) 
* Implement adding conditionals and loops to train behavior 
* Implement player making custom notifications based on train conditions, 
    like a toast pops up when the train has a certain amount of wood or something
