**** URGENT **** 

*** BUGS **** 

* Fix LinearLayout stall infinitely if too small bug 
* Fix bug clicking unresponsive ? 
* progress bar like 1% when it stops crafting
* I think there is a bug with position on chest being relative to (0, 0)
* Machine should remove required items immediately when beginning crafting 
* weird camera flash happening when clicking through inventory
    * probably need to delayed pop
* need to redraw ui when returning to train interface after adding a cart

**** NEED TO TEST **** 

* test player label change automatically when train arrives 

**** CLEAN UP **** 

* Move draw button logic into generic 
* Move click system logic into generic 

**** NEXT FEATURES **** 

* Add progress bar to overworld machines
* Make city layouts
* Add a way to speed up traveling between cities, pause
* Add a way to quickly move items between inventories (shift+click)
* Add combat and reward system
    * Rogue-like/perma-progression mix, time-limited events
      for special rewards at outside cities, permanently available 
      one at the factory. 

**** FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Make it so LinearLayout is pageable 
    * This will be important once player gets a high number of trains, 
      but also if we add a high number of machines to Factory
* Make it so trains cant run over other trains 
* Make it so trains need fuel
* Add a text input view
* Combine text input with steppers to say how much of things you want to move 
    between inventories, and how much you want to request to craft
* Add an option to steppers to make them not negative
* Add basic save/load 
* Add some default toasts
* Implement better click for buttons 
* Make stepper fast when you hold down
* Make it so button to enter train doesn't appear if player opened map not at a train station 
* Make scrollable windows 
* Add some tutorial toasts 

**** FAR FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add a tile system for rpg mode
* Implement dialogue
* Augment Sprite/DrawSystem to handle animation/spritesheets
* Write a coding language so players can code their trains 
* Implement adding commands to trains (like once it gets to the next city, do a thing) 
* Implement adding conditionals and loops to train behavior 
* Implement player making custom notifications based on train conditions, 
    like a toast pops up when the train has a certain amount of wood or something 
* Consider making a train interior so player can do certain things while waiting inside a train? 

**** NICE TO HAVE LOW PRIORITY **** 

* Add a way to print the world state for debugging
* Add SpaceEven to LinearLayout
* Add a way for sprites to be drawn separately from collision box 
* Add a label to progress bar in machine interface to make it clear what it is when not moving

**** NOT SURE WE WANT BUT MAYBE **** 

* Make drawing System based
* Make UI Drawing based on screen coordinates
* Make inventory draw messages automatically move around or resize other inventories as necessary

*** RANDOM **** 

what if there was a computer language that could derive compile-time guarantees
from the language? 

like 

function foo() {
    return 0
}

if (foo() > 0) {
    ...
}

could throw a compile-time error for a branch that'll never occur. like i guess it could 
infer bounds about the possible values of a variable and at compile-time could do checks on 
possible things? IDK
