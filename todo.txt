**** URGENT **** 

*** BUGS **** 

* Fix LinearLayout stall infinitely if too small bug 
* Fix bug clicking unresponsive ? 
* progress bar like 1% when it stops crafting

**** NEED TO TEST **** 

* test player label change automatically when train arrives 
* test machine upgrade craft time logic 
* draw machine interface (in utils/MakeMessage) 

**** CLEAN UP **** 

* convert drawMessages to drawCallbacks 
* convert click systems to onClick callbacks

**** NEXT FEATURES **** 

*   Add something to inventory to put a limit on 
    the number of items a cell can hold based on itemid, and 
    also which item ids an inventory can or cant hold 

* Add progress bar to overworld machines
* Add logic to upgrade train (speed, capacity)
* Add UI to upgrade train 
* Make city layouts
* Add a way to print the world state for debugging

**** FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Make it so LinearLayout is pageable 
    * This will be important once player gets a high number of trains, 
      but also if we add a high number of machines to Factory
* Make it so trains cant run over other trains 
* Make it so trains need fuel
* Add a text input view
* Combine text input with steppers to say how much of things you want to move 
    between inventories, and how much you want to request to craft
* Add an option to steppers to make them not negative
* Add basic save/load 
* Add some default toasts
* Implement better click for buttons 
* Make stepper fast when you hold down
* Make it so button to enter train doesn't appear if player opened map not at a train station 

**** FAR FUTURE FEATURES **** 

* Add a tile system for rpg mode
* Implement dialogue
* Augment Sprite/DrawSystem to handle animation/spritesheets
* Write a coding language so players can code their trains 
* Implement adding commands to trains (like once it gets to the next city, do a thing) 
* Implement adding conditionals and loops to train behavior 
* Implement player making custom notifications based on train conditions, 
    like a toast pops up when the train has a certain amount of wood or something 

**** NICE TO HAVE LOW PRIORITY **** 

* Add SpaceEven to LinearLayout
* Add a way for sprites to be drawn separately from collision box 
* Add a label to progress bar in machine interface to make it clear what it is when not moving

**** NOT SURE WE WANT BUT MAYBE **** 

* Make drawing System based
* Make UI Drawing based on screen coordinates
* Make inventory draw messages automatically move around or resize other inventories as necessary
